This project analyzes economic data to explore GDP, GNI per capita, investment, and trade patterns among major world economies. Tools used include Pandas, SQLite, and Plotly Express for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

    Technologies Used
    • Python • Pandas • Matplotlib • Seaborn • SQLite • Google Colab

Insights:

I. Contrasting economic philosophies:

    The United States focuses on domestic prosperity, service-based economy, high per capita GNI (~$70,000), moderate investment (21% of GDP), and a significant trade deficit ($860B).
    China prioritizes long-term expansion, reinvesting ~43% of GDP, becoming the world’s largest investor (29.5% of global capital), generating trade surpluses (~$470B), but maintaining a lower per capita GNI (~$12,324) due to population size and regional disparities.

II. Efficiency-driven economies:

    Germany and South Korea maintain high living standards and strong trade surpluses through specialized manufacturing.
    
    These nations focus on sustaining competitiveness, investing in innovation, and integrating into global partnerships.
    
    Emerging investment-led economies:
    
    India follows an aggressive investment strategy (~31% of GDP), with a focus on services and agriculture.
    
    Despite low per capita income (~$2,239), high investment indicates commitment to long-term structural growth.

III. General trends:

    High GDP does not automatically translate to high individual prosperity.
    
    Investment intensity drives long-term growth, while per capita wealth depends on population distribution and regional development.
    
    Balanced approaches (efficiency + innovation) can maintain high living standards and sustainable trade balances.

Conclusions

    The dataset highlights the contrast between short-term prosperity (US) and long-term growth strategies (China, India).
    
    Efficiency-focused economies (Germany, South Korea) demonstrate that specialization and trade surpluses sustain high standards of living.
    
    Investment-led strategies in emerging economies are essential for future expansion, but per capita wealth may remain low until growth is realized across the population.
    
    Policy insights suggest that moderate investment with targeted efficiency often yields the most sustainable economic outcomes.
